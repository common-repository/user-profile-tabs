Regroup DOM element in profile form into tabs for better UX.


== Description ==

Organize the user profile form with tabs.

If your User Profile page is way too stuffed with fields (e.g. from Paid Membership Pro), this plugin will inject CSS and Javascripts to them into sensible tabs.


### Features

* All fields in the user profile from, sectioned by H2 or H3, will be organized into tabs by javascript.
* Javascript only re-organizes the fields. The attached javascript listeners are not touched.
* Easy to use. Just works.
